Basic Python Chatbot with GUI
Overview
This project is a simple Python chatbot with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Tkinter library. The chatbot interacts with users by responding to basic queries and can handle simple natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as greetings, time requests, and basic conversations.

Features
Basic Chatbot Logic: The chatbot can respond to common queries like greetings, time requests, and exit commands.
Simple Natural Language Processing: The chatbot preprocesses input to handle user variations effectively.
Graphical User Interface: The GUI is built using Tkinter, providing a simple, user-friendly interface.
Error Handling: The chatbot includes basic error handling for unexpected inputs.
